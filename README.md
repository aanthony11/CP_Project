## Overview
Sortior is an app that keeps track of basic communal tasks that are shared between a group of people (i.e. who's turn is it to do the dishes).

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Primarily mobile as of now but could potenitally be developed for web but would not as functional as the mobile app.
- **Story:** This app connects users to easily keep track of mundane tasks. It also functions as a shared grocery list / whats in the fridge list.
- **Market:** Anyone who lives with others can use this app to organize a part of their home.
- **Habit:** It will most likely be used approximately once a week but could be used as often as daily. Wouldn't need constant interaction.
- **Scope:** The main target audience would be students in communal living in college/university but could trickle down to families as it's adopted more.
